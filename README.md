# School_District_Analysis
Use Pandas to analyze school district data and provide recommendations

## Overview of the school district analysis
Maria is a Chief Data Scientist for the City School District. She has been tasked with the responsibility to analyze school district data which is available in different formats and from different sources. She is required to analyze standardized test data (for math & reading) as well as the school funding information, to report on performance trends and provide insights about patterns which will be used to inform decisions and strategies at school and/or district level by the school board. This analysis aggregates the data and help plan school budgets and priorities using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis will include -
- **Data aggregation**  - import the data for school and students and merge into one dataframe,
- **Data wrangling** -
  - clean the student data to remove preffixes and suffixes from names and,
  - remove math and reading scores for *Thomas High School* since they were incorrectly reported.
- **Data analysis** -
  - createsummary of student and school data,
  - identify high & low performing school through trends,
  - summarize school data by grade,
  - analyze school spend and providing a summary, and
  - analyze student scores by school size and school type.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

## Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
